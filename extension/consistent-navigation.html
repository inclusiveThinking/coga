<h1>Consistent Navigation</h1>
<h2>SC Text</h2>
<p><strong>Current:</strong><br>
3.2.3 Consistent Navigation: Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple Web pages within a set of Web pages occur in the same   relative order each time they are repeated, unless a change is initiated   by the user. (Level AA)</p>

  <strong>Proposed:</strong></p>
<p>3.2.3 Consistent Navigation: Navigational mechanisms that are   repeated on multiple Web pages within a set of Web pages occur in the   same relative order each time they are repeated, unless a change is   initiated by the user. @@Common  navigation, search, and   control elements have a consistent  position within a set of web   pages in the primary modality of the content, <span id="docs-internal-guid-9beb1966-6804-c193-be68-b6ff65ee8ec7">unless a change is initiated by the user.</span>@@</p>
<p>Exception: If an inconsistent layout is an essential part of the main function of the site.</p>

<h2>Suggestion for Priority Level (AA)</h2>

<p><em>primary modality of the content</em>: the setting and physical machine interfaces considered at design time such as screen, touch, speech or mouse</p>
<h2>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</h2>
<p>Principle 3, Guideline 3.2</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The intent of this success criterion is to  ensure consistent position of common  navigation, search, and   control elements  that appear repeatedly within  a set of Web pages. For example,  controls and menu items consistently positioned across a site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>  Many users with cognitive and learning disabilities rely heavily on their  familiarity with Web page  components. If identical functions are found in different places, on different Web pages, the Web site will be considerably more  difficult to use. It will be confusing, and increase the cognitive load for  people with cognitive disabilities, increasing mistakes, and limiting some users from accessing the  content. This supports those who have reading and some visual perceptual   difficulties due to Receptive Aphasia, as well as   those with general cognitive learning disabilities. It also helps those   with visual acuity difficulties, where stroke and age-related   disabilities co-occur. Also,  users with memory impairments will need to learn a lot more  to be able to use the Web site, making it impossible for some. Therefore, consistent  styles will increase the number of people who can use the Web site, and will help many others.</p>

<h2>Testability</h2>
<p>Step 1. Ensure (by  inspection) all components, including navigation components  and icons, are positioned consistently.<br>
</p>
<h2>Techniques</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Using CSS to consistently  position common  navigation, search, and   control elements. </li>
  <li> Using a template to consistently  position common  navigation, search, and   control elements. </li>
